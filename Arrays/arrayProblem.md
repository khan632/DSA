Sorted and Increasing Order:
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] --> arr[i+1] > arr[i]

sorted and decreasing order:
let arr = [10, 9, 8, 5, 3] --> arr[i+1] < arr[i];

sorted and non-decreasing order(simply array will contain duplicate but always in increasing order)
let arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, 8] --> arr[i+1] >= arr[i]


=====================================Problems

1. find a given number's position in an array and if not find return -1, array is not sorted in  O(n) time complexity

2. Write a function to find a largest element in an array

3. Write a function to find a second largest element in an array
4. Write a function which will remove duplicate values from given array in-place [Leetcode:26]

5.Rotate an array by K elements [Leetcode:189]
